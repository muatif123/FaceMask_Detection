# FaceMask_Detection
Face Mask Detection is an openCV algorithm which is used to determine in the image or live if the person is wearing a face mask in this COVID-19 pandemic. 

The live detection uses the webcam to detect if the person is wearning a face mask or not.. The algorithm also detects the what percentage of the face is covered with mask and how much is not

The image detection algorithm is in when we feed in an image to the algorithm at which it will detect if the face in the image is covered in the face mask and how much of it is covered in it.
